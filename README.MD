Showcase of machine learning projects.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) whereby an algorithm can 
learn to predict values from input data without explicitly being taught rules. These 
algorithms rely on statistics to make inferences as they learn; they then use what they 
learn to make predictions

This repo contains common machine learning tasks, such as clustering, classification, and regression. A wide variety of datasets are used and included in the folders for each project.
